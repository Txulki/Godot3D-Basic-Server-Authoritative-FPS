I created this following mostly Gabriel Gambetta's networking explanations and guides: https://gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html
This really just handles WASD, simple camera one axis rotating sync and raycasting.
The raycasting can probably detect different types of objects if modified a little, so it can manage interactions with any world object. 
Movement seems to work pretty well, but I guess animations and jumping need to be implemented. It is just more of the same though.
